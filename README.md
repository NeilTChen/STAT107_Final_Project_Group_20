# Regular Season vs Playoffs: Shooting Efficiency Analysis

Our final project for STAT 107. We are exploring the differences in three pointer accuracy and field goal percentage in regular season games and playoff games.

This project analyzes differences in shooting efficiency at both the player and team levels using NBA league-wide datasets for the regular season and playoffs.

# Regular Season vs Playoffs: Shooting Efficiency Analysis

Our final project for STAT 107. We are exploring the differences in three pointer accuracy and field goal percentage in regular season games and playoff games.

This project analyzes differences in shooting efficiency at both the player and team levels using NBA league-wide datasets for the regular season and playoffs.


__Regular Season.csv:__
- Contains player-level NBA regular-season statistics, including field goals (FGM, FGA, FG%), three-point shooting (3PM, 3PA, 3P%), minutes, points, team, and player names.

__Playoffs.csv:__
- Contains player-level NBA playoff statistics with the same variables as the regular-season file, including field goals (FGM, FGA, FG%), three-point shooting (3PM, 3PA, 3P%), minutes, points, team, and player names.

__00_requirements.R:__
- Installs missing packages and loads all libraries needed for the project (tidyverse, ggpubr, broom, knitr).
- This file must be sourced before running any other scripts.
